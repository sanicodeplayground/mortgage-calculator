# Project Goal

The goal of MCalc is to provide a comprehensive tool for mortgage analysis. While I have experience with React projects, creating a complex financial calculator with multiple interactive components presented new challenges. My aim was to develop a product that offers detailed mortgage insights, helping users make informed decisions about their home financing.

# Job Story

When I'm considering a mortgage or managing an existing one,

I want to have a detailed, visual breakdown of all aspects of the loan, including payments, interest, and long-term financial implications,

So that I can make informed decisions about my mortgage, understand the long-term financial commitment, and explore different scenarios to optimize my home financing.

# Project Scope

The project was developed with a focus on providing comprehensive mortgage analysis tools. Features were prioritised and divided into "Now," "Then," and "Later" categories:

## Now

- Mortgage Details Calculator: Develop a form for users to input mortgage details and get comprehensive calculations.
- Visual Representations: Create various charts and graphs to visualize mortgage data.
- Loan Duration Tracking: Implement a feature to monitor elapsed and remaining loan time.
- Principal vs Interest Breakdown: Develop visualizations to show how payments are split between principal and interest over time.

## Then

- Mortgage Term Comparison: Allow users to compare different mortgage terms (15, 25, 30 years).
- Extra Payments Analysis: Implement a feature to show the impact of additional payments on the loan.

## Later

- Refinancing Calculator: Develop a tool to analyze the potential benefits of refinancing.
- Mortgage Affordability Calculator: Create a feature to help users determine how much house they can afford based on their financial situation.

# Design

# Personal Reflections

Developing MCalc has been a significant step in my journey as a developer. The complexity of financial calculations combined with the need for an intuitive user interface presented unique challenges. This project pushed me to think more deeply about user needs in financial planning tools and how to present complex information in an accessible way. I've gained confidence in my ability to tackle more complex, data-driven applications and am excited to apply these skills to future projects.
